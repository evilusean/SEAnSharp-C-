FutureProjectSean 2D Japanese Game(build in unity +use WebGL to host on Github pages) -
Or use C# with Blazor/Maui for Web+Mobile

Steps to Create and Host a Unity WebGL Game on GitHub Pages:
Create a 2D Game in Unity:

Develop your 2D game in Unity as you normally would.
Build the Game for WebGL:

Configure the build settings to target WebGL.
Build the game.
Create a GitHub Repository:

Create a new repository on GitHub to host your game.
Push the Built Files to GitHub:

Push the contents of the WebGL build to the gh-pages branch of your GitHub repository.
Enable GitHub Pages:

Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
Detailed Steps:
1. Create a 2D Game in Unity:
Open Unity and create a new 2D project.
Develop your game using Unity's tools and features.
2. Build the Game for WebGL:
Open the Build Settings in Unity (File > Build Settings).
Select WebGL as the target platform.
Click Switch Platform to switch to WebGL.
Click Build and choose a directory to save the build files.
3. Create a GitHub Repository:
Go to GitHub and create a new repository for your game.

4. Push the Built Files to GitHub:
Initialize a new Git repository in the directory where you saved the WebGL build files.
Push the contents to the gh-pages branch of your GitHub repository.
cd /path/to/your/webgl/build
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
git checkout -b gh-pages
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin gh-pages

5. Enable GitHub Pages:
Go to the settings of your GitHub repository.
Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
Select the gh-pages branch as the source.
Save the settings.
Your Unity WebGL game should now be hosted on GitHub Pages. You can access it at https://username.github.io/repository.

Example Unity WebGL Build:
Here is an example of how the directory structure might look after building your Unity game for WebGL:
/path/to/your/webgl/build
├── Build
│   ├── build.framework.js
│   ├── build.loader.js
│   ├── build.wasm
│   └── unityloader.js
├── TemplateData
│   ├── style.css
│   └── unityProgress.js
└── index.html

Example index.html:
The index.html file is generated by Unity 

-----------------
Touch Input:
Unity WebGL supports touch input, but you need to ensure your game is designed to handle touch interactions properly.
Use Unity's Input class to detect touch input and handle it appropriately in your game.

Screen Size and Orientation:
Mobile devices have varying screen sizes and orientations. Ensure your game UI is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
Use Unity's Canvas Scaler component to make your UI elements scale appropriately on different devices.

Memory Usage:
Mobile devices have limited memory compared to desktops. Optimize your game's memory usage to prevent crashes and slowdowns.
Avoid using large textures and assets that consume a lot of memory.
